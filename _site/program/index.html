Bitter, like lemons, and sometimes sweet when spring bursts with its seasonal fruit. In the present day, the four stations have become a single one. The climate is adverse, but everything is ready to document, redo and reorganize a story that encloses / encompasses so many lies, so many truths. Who can we trust? Who can we distrust, when History is told? To whom can we entrust History? So many people have already been lost, haven’t they? If they were here, we couldn’t tell this story, we couldn’t count on History.</p></div>

They promote the construction of objects that challenge their own usual logics, as well as creating a framework to speculate about multifaceted works.</p><p>Their work is based above all around the notion of crises, debunking<strong> </strong>it while suggesting new dimensions of social, political and historical nature with the intent of consolidating an increasingly urgent discourse about a future. <strong>SillySeason</strong> have sought to establish collaborative practices and networking, interacting with several artists from different areas and with several structures and institutions.</p><p>The SillySeason Collective is a structure funded by the Direção Geral das Artes - República Portuguesa.</p><p><br></p></div>

It stems from an objective observation of atmospheric weather and the binary forecast/event. The cycle of expectation / disillusionment associated with weather forecast is transposed, in accordance with the same principle of dichotomy, to human beings, given that the body is the privileged place for this research: place of destruction and reconstruction.</p></div>

This radio play is censored on the eve of its intended broadcast, on February 8, 1948. Artaud dies a month later, leaving behind a legacy of letters that express how much he had felt betrayed and misunderstood all through his life. Seventy-four years later, the <em>poète maudit </em>found justice, and his unruly genius soars over those who want to make<strong>, </strong>and like him transcend<strong>, </strong>theatre.</p><p>With this performance, that consists in a radio broadcast and a sensorial experiment for the audience, we want toacknowledge Artaud: love the poet and rebel against him with the same artistic gesture: recreate “To Have Done With the Judgment of god” and at the same time, rethink our concept of genius and of masterpieces. As he wrote himself: "The masterpieces of the past are good for the past, not for us. We have the right to say what has been said and even what has not been said in a way that is ours, immediate, direct, that responds to current ways of feeling and that the whole world understands."</p></div>

Her body is in conflict: is it as if something was born within it - a figure, a spirit? It is not known what it is. She admits the possibility that your body is under the influence of something (energies, spirits?), something that seems to want to take hold of itself or to inhabit in her.</p><p>Meanwhile, the theater company begins the process of making a new show, “Cassandra”, but the injuries (physical, psychological - all the same) of the last work remain in the body of the actress, compromising her well-being and availability to the new production. Starting from this conflict, a dialogue is established concerning questions related to illusion, belief, spiritism, theater, etc. One follows the journey of this woman, in her attempt of resolution or search for an answer to that mysterious phenomenon to which her body is now subject."</p></div>
