This radio play is censored on the eve of its intended broadcast, on February 8, 1948. Artaud dies a month later, leaving behind a legacy of letters that express how much he had felt betrayed and misunderstood all through his life. Seventy-four years later, the <em>poète maudit </em>found justice, and his unruly genius soars over those who want to make<strong>, </strong>and like him transcend<strong>, </strong>theatre.</p><p>With this performance, that consists in a radio broadcast and a sensorial experiment for the audience, we want toacknowledge Artaud: love the poet and rebel against him with the same artistic gesture: recreate “To Have Done With the Judgment of god” and at the same time, rethink our concept of genius and of masterpieces. As he wrote himself: "The masterpieces of the past are good for the past, not for us. We have the right to say what has been said and even what has not been said in a way that is ours, immediate, direct, that responds to current ways of feeling and that the whole world understands."</p></div>
